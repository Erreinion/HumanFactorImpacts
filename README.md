# Cybersecurity Human Factor Impacts
Bibliography for a Summary of Knowledge paper on the impacts of Human Factor elements in cybersecurity breaches and major incidents.

Reports from numerous sources, as well as anecdotal evidence from Incident Response and Penetration Testing experts, state that 80 - 100% of successful cybersecurity attacks and data breaches are successful only because of human error, either by end users or system adminstrators. In fact, the data suggests that less that 5% of successful attacks are the result of attacks on properly installed, configured, maintained, and operated technology. Rather, successful attacks take advantage of vulnerabilities in human processes around technology, e.g. social engineering, poor patch management, and not following indutstry norms in system configuration, like changing default administrator credentials.

Data on major cybersecurity incidents are not often made public, or they are anonimised when they are made public, which creates a barrier to research into cybersecurity human factors. 

This bibliography serves as a library of known sources that discuss root cause human factors in cybersecurity incidents.
