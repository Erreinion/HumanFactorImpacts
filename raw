“What we have learned from analysing 1,600 national level incidents is that these attackers are often relatively simple, using low-level techniques and well-known malware that exploits weaknesses in out of date software.

“Typically, these attacks are not particularly advanced, persistent or threatening, so what we have learned is that the biggest threat to cyber security is weak cyber security and that is what needs the most attention” Mr. Martin said.

"Three main reasons were cited for data breaches in the last quarter: malicious or criminal attacks (59%), human error (36%), and system fault (5%)."
"Most notifications were the direct result of cyber incidents, including phishing, malware, ransomware, brute-force attacks, compromised or stolen credentials, and hacking."
"Human error is often regarded as the main cause of cyber security incidents. But it was only the second most common cause of data breaches during the last quarter."

"Not all insider threats are deliberate. In a survey of its attendees, organizers of the annual Black Hat security conference showed that 84 percent of cyberattacks reported had been due to human error, Computer Weekly reported. This could include failing to apply a patch, using easy-to-guess passwords or leaving physical devices in an unsafe area."

Opinion Piece:
Nuix "The Human Vulnerability" 
"One of the key findings of my research is that technology is rarely the cause of data
breaches – in the more than 2,500 breaches I have investigated, I can count exactly
zero that were caused by a random, non-human-initiated system failure"

Jordan Schroeder
Every breach report in the media seems to indicate some human factor as a root cause.
